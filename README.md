<h1>Under The Barbell</h1>
<h3>Full Stack Python: Physical Therapy App</h3>
<p>Using BCrypt and session for user authenication, Under The Barbell allows users to create an account, in which each user has access to the app's library of workout videos. After watching the video, the user can then create a completed instance with how many reps and any notes they want their Physical Therapist to know. Each instance is stored in a MySQL database, which can be referenced from the user's dashboard. From there the user can edit, delete, or view each instance. The Physical Therapist has elevated privleges, which allows them to leave comments on each instance, viewing all workouts by individual users, and granting admin privleges to other users.</p>
